  "descriptionShort": "Hola! I'm a passionate frontend developer with a background in digital design. Over the past two years, I’ve explored both frontend and backend development, and I’m now seeking an internship to refine my skills and learn new technologies. In the future, my ambition is to grow into a full-stack role and to advocate for more women to step confidently into IT. I’m a reliable team player who enjoys tackling new challenges and finding creative solutions.",
  "descriptionLong": "My journey in IT began with digital design \u2013 a safe entry into the IT world for someone like me, who struggled with internal doubts and stereotypes. Did I really belong in development?\n\nMy background in digital design not only gave me solid knowledge in accessibility and UX but also shaped me into the developer I am today \u2013 one with a keen eye for visual design. Now, after two years of dedicated studies in frontend development, during which I also had the opportunity to work with backend technologies, there\u2019s no longer any doubt in my mind that there\u2019s a place for me in this industry.\n\nMy journey has strengthened my self-confidence, sparked my ambition to grow into a full-stack role, and made it natural for me to advocate for more women to step confidently into IT.\n\nNow, I look forward to further strengthening my skills, exploring new languages and technologies, and contributing my expertise to an innovative team!",
