  "descriptionLong": "My journey in IT began with digital design \u2013 a safe entry into the IT world for someone like me, who struggled with internal doubts and stereotypes. Did I really belong in development?\n\nMy background in digital design not only gave me solid knowledge in accessibility and UX but also shaped me into the developer I am today \u2013 one with a keen eye for visual design. Now, after two years of dedicated studies in frontend development, during which I also had the opportunity to work with backend technologies, there\u2019s no longer any doubt in my mind that there\u2019s a place for me in this industry.\n\nMy journey has strengthened my self-confidence, sparked my ambition to grow into a full-stack role, and made it natural for me to advocate for more women to step confidently into IT.\n\nNow, I look forward to further strengthening my skills, exploring new languages and technologies, and contributing my expertise to an innovative team!",
